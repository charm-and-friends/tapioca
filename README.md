# Glitter

Add some dynamic [bubbbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
elements to your existing application.

## Why should you use Glitter?

- You have a useful application with a pragmatic command line interface. It
doesn't matter if it is complex and uses
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) or if it is simple and uses
[flag](https://pkg.go.dev/flag).

- You already have set in place some logging mechanism. Again, it doesn't
matter if you are using [log](https://pkg.go.dev/log) or
[zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).

- You want to add some dynamic elements. A simple progress bar or something way
  more complex.

Add some Glitter to your application. With all the flexibility of
[bubbbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) but without its
complexity. As simple as two lines of code.
